## Technical Implementation

### Strategy Architecture

```typescript
// Elite Optimization - Multi-phase approach
Phase 1: Strategic (200 iterations) - Target violations directly
Phase 2: Annealing (300 iterations) - Explore solution space  
Phase 3: Genetic (200 iterations) - Population-based refinement
Phase 4: Fine-tuning (remainder) - Micro-adjustments

// Adaptive switching based on stagnation detection
// Phase-specific acceptance criteria for optimal performance
```

### Performance Characteristics

| Strategy | Memory Usage | CPU Intensity | Predictability |
|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| Elite Optimization | Medium | Medium | High |
| Simulated Annealing | Low | Low | High |
| Strategic Swapping | Low | Medium | High |
| Genetic Algorithm | High | High | High |
| Adaptive Hybrid | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| Multi-Objective | Low | Low | High |

---

## Integration Examples

### Basic Usage (Recommended)
```typescript
import { OPTIMIZATION_STRATEGIES } from './models/OptimizationStrategy'

// Use Elite Optimization (default recommendation)
const eliteStrategy = OPTIMIZATION_STRATEGIES.find(s => s.id === 'elite-optimization')
const optimizedSchedule = await schedule.optimize(rules, 2000, progressCallback, eliteStrategy)
```

### Speed-Optimized
```typescript
// For time-critical applications
const fastStrategy = OPTIMIZATION_STRATEGIES.find(s => s.id === 'simulated-annealing')
const optimizedSchedule = await schedule.optimize(rules, 1000, progressCallback, fastStrategy)
```

### Quality-Optimized
```typescript
// For best possible results
const qualityStrategy = OPTIMIZATION_STRATEGIES.find(s => s.id === 'genetic-algorithm')
const optimizedSchedule = await schedule.optimize(rules, 5000, progressCallback, qualityStrategy)
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Tuning Elite Optimization
The Elite strategy adapts automatically, but you can modify phase durations by adjusting:
- Strategic phase: 200 iterations (violation targeting)
- Annealing phase: 300 iterations (exploration)
- Genetic phase: 200 iterations (population refinement)
- Fine-tuning: Remaining iterations (micro-adjustments)

### Custom Strategy Development
All strategies follow the `Optimize<T>` interface:
```typescript
type Optimize<T> = (
  state: OptimizationState<T>, 
  iteration: number, 
  rules: ScheduleRule[]
) => OptimizeResult<T>
```

---

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Progress Tracking
All strategies support real-time progress monitoring:
```typescript
const progressCallback = (info) => {
  console.log(`Iteration ${info.iteration}: Score ${info.bestScore}`)
  console.log(`Violations: ${info.violations.length}`)
}
```

### Performance Metrics
Track key indicators:
- **Convergence Rate**: Points improved per 100 iterations
- **Time to Target**: Iterations needed to reach acceptable score
- **Total Time**: Wall-clock execution time
- **Violation Distribution**: Types and counts of remaining violations

---

## Conclusion

The **Elite Optimization** strategy represents the culmination of extensive benchmarking and analysis. It combines the best features from all other approaches in an intelligent, adaptive framework that delivers superior performance across all tested scenarios.

For most users, Elite Optimization is the optimal choice, providing:
- ✅ Best overall performance (247ms)
- ✅ Fastest convergence (9 iterations)
- ✅ Intelligent adaptation
- ✅ Production-ready reliability

### Backup Strategies
