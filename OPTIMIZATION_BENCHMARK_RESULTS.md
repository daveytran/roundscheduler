# Round Scheduler Optimization Strategy Benchmark Results

## Executive Summary

This document presents the results of comprehensive benchmarking performed on six different optimization strategies for the Round Scheduler application. The benchmark evaluated each strategy's ability to solve complex tournament scheduling problems with multiple constraints.

## Test Scenario

### Tournament Configuration
- **8 Mixed Division Teams** (28 matches)
- **6 Gendered Division Teams** (15 matches) 
- **4 Cloth Division Teams** (6 matches)
- **Total**: 49 matches across 3 fields
- **Initial Score**: 2,840 violations
- **Target Score**: 0 violations (perfect schedule)

### Constraints Tested
1. **Field Conflicts** (Priority 15) - No double-booking of fields
2. **Back-to-Back Games** (Priority 10) - Teams shouldn't play consecutive matches
3. **Player Rest Time** (Priority 8) - Minimum rest between player games
